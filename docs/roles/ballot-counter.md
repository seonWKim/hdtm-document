# Ballot counter

## Description

The Ballot Counter collects and counts votes for meeting awards, such as Best Speaker, Best Evaluator, and Best Table
Topics Speaker. They explain the voting process at the beginning of the meeting, distribute and collect ballots, and
ensure votes are counted accurately. At the end of the meeting, they help the toastmaster announce the winners, adding a
fun, competitive element to the session.

In HDTM, officers usually take ballot counter roles because they have the access to admin vote link.
