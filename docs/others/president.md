1. To be eligible to compete in the International Speech Contest, contestants must be a paid member of a club in the
   area, division, and district in which they are competing. In addition, contestants must have completed six speech
   projects in the Competent Communication manual or in Levels 1 and 2 of any path in the Toastmasters Pathways learning
   experience. If a contestant does not meet both criteria, they must be disqualified.
2. Each contestant must be physically present to compete. Recorded audio, video, or other remote technology is not
   allowed.
3. If a contestant is absent from the briefing, an alternate person is permitted to attend the briefing in place of the
   primary contestant. If the primary contestant is not present at the contest on time, they are disqualified.
4. The International Speeches must be from five to seven minutes. A contestant will be disqualified if the speech is
   less than four minutes 30 seconds or more than seven minutes 30 seconds.

- A green signal will be displayed at five minutes and remain displayed for one minute.
- A yellow signal will be displayed at six minutes and remain displayed for one minute.
- A red signal will be displayed at seven minutes and will remain on until the conclusion of the speech.
- In all speech contests, no signal can be given for the overtime period. However, in the event of technical failure of
  the signal or timing equipment, a speaker is allowed 30 seconds extra overtime before being disqualified. Prior to
  announcing results, the contest chair must announce if time disqualifications occurred, but not name the contestant(s)
  involved.

5. Contestants who plan to use props (including any sort of electronic devices) must notify the contest chair prior to
   the contest. All props must be set up during the minute of silence prior to the contestant’s speech, including the
   microphone.
6. Protests are limited to eligibility and originality and must only be lodged by voting judges and contestants. Any
   protest must be submitted to the chief judge and/or contest chair prior to the announcement of the winner and
   alternate(s). The chief judge, contest chair, voting judges, and contestants must not consider protests from audience
   members. The contest chair can disqualify a contestant on the basis of eligibility.
7. A third-place, a second-place, and a first-place winner will be announced (if there are more than 3 contestants). The
   first-place winner is allowed to compete in the Area Speech Contest.

## Example of the Contest Chair Script

Hello, Toastmasters. My name is `name`, the HDTM contest chair. I’ll lead the Club Speech Contest today. Briefly, first
the International Speech Contest, and Korean Speech Contest. There are O Korean Contestants and O International Speech
Contestants.

Now, I’ll introduce the Speech Contest Rules briefly.

1. Please make sure your cell phone is on silent. It helps prevent unexpected situations.
2. Only a single-camera setup is permitted. So, except for the designated person, no one is allowed to do it.
3. Recording, such as by adding text, graphics, images, or anything that doesn’t meet the requirements above, is not
   allowed in the Area Contest.
4. About protests, any judge and contestant can make a protest about eligibility and originality. Any protest must be
   submitted to the chief judge and/or contest chair prior to the announcement of the winner.
5. Judges. Our chief judge Chelsea leads the role takers. Thank you so much. There are voting judges, but they must keep
   their identities secret forever.
6. Timing Rules. It will be managed by our timers `name` & `name`. They will show the timer’s card. A contestant must
   make a speech from 5 to 7 minutes. They will be disqualified if their speech is shorter than 4:30 and longer than
   7:30. Do not make signals for the overtime period. It is not allowed. If a time disqualification occurs, the contest
   chair (me) must announce it prior to announcing results, but not name the contestant(s) involved. Before the
   speech, please check where they are.
7. Counters, `name1` & `name2`. They will collect all the voting sheets. After the Contest, I’ll give time to get the
   voting sheets. Thank all role takers.
