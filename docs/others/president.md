Hello, Toastmasters. My name is `name`, the HDTM contest chair. I’ll lead the Club Speech Contest today. Briefly, first
the International Speech Contest, and Korean Speech Contest. There are O Korean Contestants and O International Speech
Contestants.

Now, I’ll introduce the Speech Contest Rules briefly.

1. Please make sure your cell phone is on silent. It helps prevent unexpected situations.
2. Only a single-camera setup is permitted. So, except for the designated person, no one is allowed to do it.
3. Recording, such as by adding text, graphics, images, or anything that doesn’t meet the requirements above, is not
   allowed in the Area Contest.
4. About protests, any judge and contestant can make a protest about eligibility and originality. Any protest must be
   submitted to the chief judge and/or contest chair prior to the announcement of the winner.
5. Judges. Our chief judge Chelsea leads the role takers. Thank you so much. There are voting judges, but they must keep
   their identities secret forever.

   make a speech from 5 to 7 minutes. They will be disqualified if their speech is shorter than 4:30 and longer than
   7:30. Do not make signals for the overtime period. It is not allowed. If a time disqualification occurs, the contest
   chair (me) must announce it prior to announcing results, but not name the contestant(s) involved. Before the
   speech, please check where they are.
7. Counters, `name1` & `name2`. They will collect all the voting sheets. After the Contest, I’ll give time to get the
   voting sheets. Thank all role takers.
