# Table Topics Master

## Description

The table topic master delivers the table topic sessions of the meeting, which helps train members to quickly organize
and express their thoughts in an impromptu setting. As table topics master, you should do the following:

- Select topics in advance of the meeting that allow speakers to offer their thoughts.
- Give members who aren't assigned a speaking role the opportunity to speak during the meeting.
- Don't ask two people the same thing unless you designed the session to allow this.

## Table Topic Session

Table topics is usually scheduled after the break time. Upon return of everyone from the short break, the meeting
resumes with the president(or chairperson) assuming control. The president then introduces the table topics master who
takes control of the meeting.

> Greetings Mr and Madam toastmaster, fellow toastmasters and guests. The purpose of the table topics master is to lead
> table topics, where guests and members will have the opportunity to practice their impromptu speaking. I will
> introduce a topic or question. I will then ask for volunteers or call on attendees to speak. Speakers have up to two
> minutes to speak on the subject. For those new to table topics the minimum time you should try to speak is one minute.

Then present the first topic or question.

> The first topic is `<topic>`.

A volunteer offers to respond to the topic question. If there are no volunteer, you can ask any audience to participate.
After the topic or question response has completed, the table topic master thanks the volunteer or the speaker who was
called on to respond.

Upon completion of whole table topics

> Thank you everyone for participating in the table topics session. Timer, please give the times for each speaker.

Return control back to the president(or chairperson).

> Now I return my control back to our president.
