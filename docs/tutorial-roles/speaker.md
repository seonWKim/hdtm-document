# Speaker

## Description

The Toastmaster Speaker is responsible for delivering a prepared speech during the meeting. The speaker's role is to
present their speech in a clear, engaging, and effective manner, adhering to the time limits and objectives set for
their speech project.

Normally, the time limit for speeches ranges from 5 to 7 minutes, with a grace period of 30 seconds before and after.
Ice-breaking speeches typically span from 4 to 6 minutes. If you need to adjust the duration of your speech, please
consult with the toastmaster and chairperson to see if it is possible.

## How to Deliver Speech

To deliver a speech, you must first become a member of HDTM. Additionally, you should register as a speaker at the
previous meeting or consult with the officers.

Refer to the pathway you selected on the Toastmasters International
website. Inform your evaluator about the pathway project and level you are working on, as well as the title of your
speech.

During the meeting, the toastmaster will call each speaker to the stage to deliver their speeches. Your speech
will be timed and evaluated. If you wish to record your speech, ask someone at the meeting to do so.

### After Delivering Speech

After delivering your speech, visit the Toastmasters International website to mark your pathway project as completed.
Review your speech with your evaluator and research ways to improve your future speeches.
