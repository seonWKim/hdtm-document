# Ah-counter

## Description

The Ah-Counter helps members improve their speaking clarity by identifying filler words and sounds (
like "ah," "um," "you know") and repeated phrases. At the start of the meeting, they explain their role and what they
will be listening for. Throughout the meeting, they track these instances for all speakers. At the end, they present a
report, offering valuable feedback to reduce distracting habits.

## Toastmaster Session

When introduced by the general evaluator, please state the following:

> Greetings Mr and Madam toastmaster, fellow toastmasters and guests. The purpose of the ah-counter is to note words and
> sounds that are used as a "pause filler" by anyone who speaks. During the meeting, I will listen for overused words,
> including `and`, `well`, `but`, `so`, and `you know`. I will also listen for filler sounds, including `ah`, `um`, and
`er`. I will also note when a speaker repeats a word or phrase, such as `I, I`, or `This means, this means`. At the end
> of the meeting, I will report the number of times that each speaker used these expressions.
>
> Thank you, Mr/Madam toastmaster.

## Evaluation Session

When introduced by the general evaluator, please provide your report.

> Thank you `<general evaluator name>`, I'll give ah-counter report.

Provide your report based on the ah-counter log, and return control of the meeting back to the general evaluator.

> That concludes my report, I return control of the meeting to `<general evaluator name>`
