# Timer

## Description

The Timer ensures meetings run on schedule by tracking the time of speeches, table topics, and evaluations. They explain
the timing rules at the start and use colored signals (green, yellow, red) to alert speakers of their progress. The
Timer records the actual time taken for each speaker and provides a brief report at the end, helping members develop
time management skills in their speeches.

## Toastmaster Session

When introduced by the general evaluator, please state the following

> Greetings Mr and Madam toastmaster, fellow toastmasters and guests. As timer, I will time the speeches, table topics
> and the evaluations. I will also alert each speaker of the time they have left, using the green, yellow and red cards
> ,which denote specific times remaining. 
> 
> Table topics for example: 
> - At 1 minutes, I will raise the green card.
> - At 1 minute and 30 seconds, I will raise the yellow card.
> - At 2 minutes, I will raise the red card, signaling the speaker to finish.
