# Timer

## Description

The Timer in Toastmasters ensures meetings run on schedule by tracking the time of speeches, table topics, and
evaluations. They explain the timing rules at the start and use colored signals (green, yellow, red) to alert speakers
of their progress. The Timer records the actual time taken for each speaker and provides a brief report at the end,
helping
members develop time management skills in their speeches.

Explain how you will time each session for example

> At 1 minutes, I will raise the green card.
> At 1 minute and 30 seconds, I will raise the yellow card.
> At 2 minutes, I will raise the red card, signaling the speaker to finish.

Refer to following table for timing information.

| Name                | Green Card | Yellow Card      | Red Card |
|---------------------|------------|------------------|----------|
| Normal Speech       | 5 min      | 6 min            | 7 min    |
| Ice Breaking Speech | 4 min      | 5 min            | 6 min    |
| Table Topics        | 1 min      | 1 min 30 seconds | 2 min    |
| Evaluations         | 2 min      | 2 min 30 seconds | 3 min    |
